How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can see changes done between versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can find previous idea (code) faster.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Logical point of view to changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The files are connected. There is relation between them.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log, git diff id1 id2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can find last version where the bug didn't exist.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
